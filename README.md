##Do Now
Begin this session by completing the [Do Now](doNow.md) activity.

##Scope
You have just been hired by Social Media, But Better! LLC. For your first project you will be creating a webapp that uses the Flickr API to display photos tagged with anything the user types in. Your manager would like to test your skills. She has given you starter code with plenty of comments for completion. You have been given one week to make a fully functioning webapp.

##Project Criteria
Your Manager has laid out the following requirements for the project:

* The webapp will display 9 thumbnails of photos related to anything the user types in
* The user must be able to click the search button to display related thumbnails
* On any subsequent search, the system shall clear the prior results and show images reflecting results from the new search query.
* If the user clicks a "reset" button, the system shall clear the results of all thumbnails and clear the search bar of any text


##Learning Objectives
By the end of this project the employee will be able to...

* Register their application with Flickr to obtain a client id
* Get information from Flickr using its API
* Append images to and HTML page
* Empty content from a selected div

##References/Tools
* [Flickr Developers Guide](https://www.flickr.com/services/developer/api/)


##Vocabulary

* Append
* Empty
* Index
* Mouseover
* Endpoint
* Callback

##Instructions

You are given Starter Code for this project which you must clone into your own workspace.
You will notice there are two js files. `flickr_client.js` is the work provided to you and `script.js` is the work you must complete. In order to understand what components you must build in script.js you must carefully read and understand the contents of flickr_client.js.

####In order to make this webapp functional to the standards set out by your manager, you will need to complete the tasks below:

###1) Clone this repo into your own Cloud9 workspace


###2) Authentication
Authenticate your webapp by placing the client id you acquired in the [Do Now](doNow.md) into your code. Guidance on the process can be found in the [Flickr Developers Guide](https://www.flickr.com/services/developer/api/).

###2) script.js
In this file you will need to ready your document in order make the API call based on user input. 10 images will appear as thumbnails as a result of evaluating the results of the user input.

###3) Reset!
Add a button named "reset" to your webapp. This button shall clear all thumbnail images and the search bar of any text from the previous search.

###Bonus)
Your Manager has offered a stipend of $500 for each of the bonus requirements listed below:

* On mouseover, the Flickr username shall display over the thumbnail image
* If the user clicks on a thumbnail, an overlay shall show with a larger version of the image, as well as the caption and the number of “likes” (if any) the image has received.
